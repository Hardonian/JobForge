# Governance

## Maintainers

JobForge is maintained by the repository maintainers. Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues and discussions
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct and security policy
- Publishing releases and changelog updates

## Decision Making

- **Small changes** (docs, fixes, minor refactors): consensus in the pull request.
- **Substantial changes** (new features, schema changes, or architectural shifts): open a GitHub Discussion before implementation and document the decision in the PR description.

If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers will make the final call based on project goals and stability.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Consistent contributors who demonstrate good judgment and care for project quality may be invited to become maintainers. If you are interested, start a Discussion describing how you would like to help.

## Communication

- **Project planning**: GitHub Discussions
- **Tracking work**: GitHub Issues
- **Security reports**: GitHub Security Advisories (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
